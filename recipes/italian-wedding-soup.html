        <p> Italian wedding soup is just one of those foods. You know the kind of food that you think about when you're 
            doing an online self-guided course for learning full-stack web development and you need to come up with
            another food recipe to put in your practice website. That being said I actually really enjoy Italian Wedding
            soup. </p> <div class = "bold-n-brash listen-up"> I HOPE YOU DO TOO!!! </div>

            <li> ½ teaspoon dried basil </li>
            <li> ½ teaspoon onion powder </li>
            <li> 5 ¾ cups chicken broth </li>
            <li> 2 cups thinly sliced escarole </li>

        <ol>
            <li> Combine ground beef, egg, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, basil, and onion powder in a bowl. </li>
            <li> Shape beef mixture into 3/4-inch balls and place on a parchment-lined tray. </li>
            <li> Heat broth in a large pot over medium-high heat until boiling. Stir in escarole, orzo, carrot, and meatballs and 
                return to boil. Reduce heat to medium and cook at slow boil, stirring frequently to prevent sticking, 
                until pasta is tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. </li>
            <li> Serve hot and enjoy! </li>

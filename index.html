        <h2> Thank For Visiting McK777's Tip T.O.P. Odin Recipes Page </h2>
        <p> I really hope you get the most out of your visit. As tedious as it all was I'm actually really satisfied with
            the work I put into this little website. Had I ever realized I'd have so much fun creating stuff like this I'd
            probably have years of HTML and more under my belt. Needless to say I really am greatful to 
            <a href = "https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer"> "The Odin Project" </a>
            for helping me make it this far. I know I've a long way to go, but I'm excited and looking forward to it. </p>
        <p> Don't forget though, these recipes are actually real. If you want to actually make them I'm sure (and don't
            hold me to this I've tested nothing) they are actually good enough recipes to give the old college try. Your
            mileage may vary of course but I've replicated them word for word off of <a href = "https://www.allrecipes.com/"
            target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer" > allrecipes.com </a> . Special thanks to those hard working
            cooks and chefs that put these recipes together cause realistically all I did was copy them. </p>

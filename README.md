# odin-recipes
This is the html project for The Odin Project Fundamentals course. Assignment "Recipes".
I've really been loving this course so far and cannot wait to continue to get into the meat of it. I already feel like I've learned so much.

I've just put the finishing touches on my little recipes website and I feel immense satisfaction at seeing something that even with little actual substance could pass as a functional and not alltogether offensive looking recipe website. There's no doubt in my mind I'll be revisiting this repo on my own time to do CSS and Javascript as I learn those and progress. Thanks to "The Odin Project"!
